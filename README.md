# LFS QEMU Auto-Installer

This is for fun and learning. It is not intended for production use.
This is not working 100% yet either.
Do not use this at all yet.


Run this command in your Arch Linux VM (as root) to download and start the installer:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathisen99/lfs/main/bootstrap.sh)
```
